While creating this website, I learned how to do:

- The slider in the home section, this slider uses the transform and flex properties, it is animated.
- Photo galleries using css grid
- A 3d business card that rotates 180 degrees on mouse over
- Interesting animation which, when you hover the mouse over the inscription "follow us", shows the possible options for social media.
